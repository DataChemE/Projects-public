Thank you for your interest in my public projects. The projects are the following:

1. Carbon Emissions project: This project pulled data from the Energy Information Association government API. 
This project shows my API data extraction and exploratory data analysis skills. 
Once the data was extracted it was loaded into a CSV which was used to create a Tableau workbook. 
This workbook is public on: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/datacheme/viz/emissionsworkbook/FuelTypeStateDashboardwithFilters


2. Image Classification: This project uses a tensorflow neural network to classify brain MRIs. 
There are 4 classes of different Alzheimer's stages of progression. The data is from a kaggle dataset. 
This project utlized my computer's internal computing abilities to make calculations.


3. Ulta Scraping Project and Cosmetic Ingredient List Classification model (ulta.com): This project displays 
my public website scraping skills. I scraped all of the haircare categories, and made a ML NLP model 
that could classify what type of product it was based on the ingredient list. I used the shampoo/conditioner 
category to test whether it could distinguish whether a product was a shampoo or conditioner. This model has 95% accuracy. 
You can browse both the spiderCrawler "ulta_crawl.py" and the "ingredient_compares.py" files if you want to see how this was done.
